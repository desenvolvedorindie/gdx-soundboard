### The Problem

This tool aims to improve the workflow between game programmer and the audio engineer. gdx-soundboard addresses the problem where audio-engineers want to describe events and event transitions without touching code. gdx-soundboard solves with easy-to-use GUI and the ability to export json.

## The Workflow
    * Your audio guy creates music tracks for the game.
    * Your audio guy specifies transitions between these tracks.
    * Your audio guy saves the track by exporting the json.
    * You import the json in your game using the library.
    * You fire events and the music automatically transitions using the defined transitions.

### Supports:

Standard libgdx formats: ogg, wav and mp3.

- Fade in / out
